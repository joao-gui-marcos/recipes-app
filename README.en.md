## üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed:

-   A recipe app was developed, using the most modern within the React ecosystem: Hooks and Context API!

    It is possible to: view, search, filter, favorite and follow the progress of preparing food and drink recipes!

    The database is 2 different APIs, one for food and one for drinks.

    The layout focuses on mobile devices, so all prototypes are developed on smaller screens.

:bulb:**See a sample below:**

## Skills used:

-   Use_Redux_to manage state
-   use the library_React-Redux_
-   Using the Context API of_React_to manage state
-   use the_React Hook useState_
-   use the_React Hook useContext_
-   use the_React Hook useEffect_
-   Create custom Hooks

# requirements

In this project, the person using the app can search for a specific recipe, explore recipes based on different criteria, favorite and make the recipes, among other features.

The screens vary depending on the type of recipe (if it is food or drink, in this case).

Note: The way APIs should be structured follows the following models:<https://www.themealdb.com/api.php>e<https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php>

## Unitary tests

### 1 - Develop unit tests so that coverage is at least 90%

<br />
<details>
  <summary><strong>Observa√ß√µes t√©cnicas</strong></summary>

-   In this requirement we will cover our application with unit/integration tests using the library[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), take this opportunity to put into practice the[Test Driven Development](https://blog.betrybe.com/tecnologia/tdd-test-driven-development/)

-   Remember that in Test Driven Development, you must write the tests along with the development of new features. For this reason, this requirement will only pass the evaluator as long as your application has the desired test coverage. If you add new functionality and don't create tests for it, this requirement may stop passing the evaluator.

-   The tests you create will not influence the other requirements in the evaluator. You will develop your unit/integration tests using the React Testing Library, while the evaluator will use the library[Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/)to assess requirements, including coverage requirements.
